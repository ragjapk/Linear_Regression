# Linear_Regression
Linear Regression Implementation 

#Direct Method
-Least Square cost function is used to find the parameter.
-The direct method finds the inverse of the parameter W directly.
-Data Input should have feature attributes(unknowns) to be less than the total no of sample points(Data3).

#Iterative Method
-Least Square cost function is used to find the parameter.
-The iterative method estimates the parameter W by applying optimization technique: gradient descent. 
-Data Input should have feature attributes(unknowns) to be less than the total no of sample points(Data3).

#Lagrange Method
-Lagrange constrained optimization technique is used to estimate the unknown parameter.
-Data Input should have feature attributes(unknowns) to be greater than the total no of sample points(Data4).

#Cross validation
-Code written for performing hold out and k-fold cross validation operations prior to performing linear regression
